# AI-Enhanced Mathematical Modeling of Neutron Capture in Hybrid Nuclear Reactors

**Author:** Duvall Roberts

## Introduction

This project focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the mathematical modeling of neutron capture in hybrid nuclear reactors. Hybrid reactors, which combine nuclear fusion and fission processes, have the potential to improve energy output and reactor safety. The AI component of this model allows for real-time adaptive adjustments, improving predictive accuracy, operational efficiency, and overall safety by continuously responding to reactor conditions based on real-time data.

### Research Question

"How can AI-enhanced mathematical modeling optimize neutron capture and utilization efficiency in hybrid reactors that combine nuclear fusion and fission processes?"

### Information Gathering

The development of this model is based on both theoretical foundations and empirical data:

- **Theoretical Foundations:** Theoretical physics principles, such as neutron flux, cross-sections, and fuel density, were derived from *Theoretical Physics* by Georg Joos.
- **Contemporary Approaches:** Peer-reviewed articles by Ripani (2022) and Wilkins (2024) informed the contemporary understanding of neutron capture within hybrid reactors.
- **Empirical Data:** Data sourced from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provided the empirical basis for training the AI models, including datasets on neutron flux distributions, cross-sections for Helium-3 in fusion reactions, and Uranium-235 in fission reactions.

### Assessment

This project integrates traditional neutron transport equations with AI-enhanced dynamic optimization to create a more responsive and adaptable model for managing hybrid reactors. By using real-time data from experimental reactor environments, this AI-driven approach improves safety and operational efficiency.

## Model Development

### Model Selection

The selected model combines traditional deterministic differential equations with AI-based parameter predictions. This integration allows for real-time adjustments, making the model more flexible and adaptive to the unique challenges posed by the hybrid reactor's fusion and fission processes.

### Key Equations

1. **Fusion Reaction Dynamics:**

   `dN_fusion/dt = AI_predict(density_fuel, σ_fusion, φ)`

   - Models neutron production during fusion reactions.
   - AI dynamically adjusts neutron yield predictions based on real-time data.

2. **Fission Reaction Dynamics:**

   `dN_fission/dt = AI_predict(density_fuel, σ_fission, N) - λ * N`

   - AI adjusts for neutron production and absorption rates, using real-time data to modify predictions.

3. **Overall Neutron Population Dynamics:**

   `dN/dt = dN_fusion/dt + dN_fission/dt`

   - Integrates the fusion and fission dynamics to predict overall neutron population changes.

### Real-World Data Integration

The model is trained on IAEA datasets, which provide critical empirical data on neutron yield, cross-sections, and flux distributions in Helium-3 fusion and Uranium-235 fission reactions. This data enables the AI model to dynamically adjust predictions for neutron behavior based on real-time reactor conditions.

## Analysis and Results

### Results

The AI-enhanced model was tested in a simulated hybrid reactor environment, demonstrating strong performance in predicting neutron population dynamics in both fusion and fission reactions. The AI component successfully adjusted predictions in real time, leading to more accurate simulations of neutron production and absorption.

### Limitations

The model's performance is currently limited by the availability of real-world data. While the IAEA datasets provide valuable empirical evidence, more comprehensive data from operational reactors are needed to refine the model further. Additionally, the model assumes simplified reactor geometries, which may limit its applicability to more complex designs.

## Conclusion

The integration of AI into mathematical models for neutron capture in hybrid nuclear reactors offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and adaptability. By leveraging real-time data inputs, the AI-enhanced model can dynamically adjust key reactor parameters, improving both safety and operational efficiency. Further refinement and integration of more comprehensive datasets will enhance the model's robustness and accuracy.
